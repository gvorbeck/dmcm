_Example Adventure_ is an example set up to show how DMCM adventure file architecture is set up. This text is read from the `index.mdx` file in the adventure's root directory. A number of frontmatter fields can be placed in this file to give further details regarding the adventure, such as its title, levels, player number, setting, and a list of external links that may supplement your notes. Open the `index.mdx` file in your favorite editor to see how this is formatted.
