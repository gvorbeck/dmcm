    This is **flavor text** written in markdown. Wow, that a _scary_ entrance. Dust and spiders lurk here where adventurers are seldom seen.

    #### Occupants
    * 2 [Goblins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/goblin).

    #### Environment
    * The main gates, made of bronze-covered wood, have corroded and collapsed.
    * Any dice formulas in text will be turned into buttons to roll from!
        * example: d20, 5d6, it's so easy - 3d12! It may be finicky sometimes. Make sure it isn't wrapped in HTML tags or at the end of a sentence. I'll work on this.
    #### Developments
    * Hover your mouse over the yellow strip at the bottom of your screen. Your players' info will be displayed. Right now it's just their passive perception, but maybe I'll put more here soon. It's just the thing I always need from my players and don't want to ask.
    * Any loud noises here attract attention from Goblins in **area 7**.
    #### Treasure
    * A single **MacGuffin** is located in the southeast corner.
    #### XP
    * The party splits 5,000 xp for being great. And defeating the goblins.

    This is a second room. I gave it a cool name that I will probably use for an actual game. This room is filled with old telescopes, several of which are in disrepair. A single one in the center of the room is trained on the window in the northern wall. In the window a craggy moon is perfectly framed in the night sky.
  callout: |
    This is a **callout box**. You can use it as a special piece of content that instructs you how to handle a particular device within this location (ex: "What the goblins know" or "Roleplaying the Fireball Wizard").
    * This can be used for whatever, but it is a discrete section of content.

    #### Occupants
    * None.

This is where you can put "General features" for this map. Include things like:
* **Doors**. Doors in this room are made of clay. They are awful. Why would anyone make clay doors?
* **Ceilings**. Ceilings are 10 feet high and are entirely unremarkable.
