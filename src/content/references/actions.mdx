  - title: Attack
    short: Perform a melee or ranged attack with your weapon.
    cite: PHB, pgs. 192,194-195
    text: |
      Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action. Each of these attacks is a separate roll and may target different creatures. You may move in between these attacks.

      When you attack with a light melee weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with your other hand (see the _Offhand attack_ bonus action).

      You may replace one of your melee attacks with a Grapple or a Shove.

      Some conditions give advantage on the attack: attacks against blinded, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, stunned, or unconscious targets; melee attacks against prone targets; attacks by invisible or hidden attackers.

      Some conditions give disadvantage on the attack: attacks against invisible or hidden targets; ranged attacks against prone targets; attacks by blinded, frightened, poisoned, or restrained attackers.
  - title: Cast a Spell
    short: Cast time of one action.
    cite: PHB, pg. 192
    text: |
      You can't cast a spell with you action and a different spell with your bonus action in the same turn, except if the action is used to cast a cantrip.

      The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover.

      Spells with material components do not consume the material unless explicitly stated. Unless the cost of a material is given, you can assume that the cost is negligible and the material is simply available in a component pouch.

      Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration or when you are incapacitated. Each time you take damage, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher.
  - title: Dash
    short: Double movement speed.
    cite: PHB, pg. 192
    text: |
      The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers.
  - title: Disarm
    short: Knock target's weapon to the ground.
    cite: Improvised.
    text: |
      Attack roll vs. target’s Athletics or Acrobatics. No damage on success, but target drops held item. Attack has disadvantage if target item is being held in both hands. Use of your free item interaction can be used to pick target's weapon up or you can just kick it across the floor.
  - title: Disengage
    short: Prevent opportunity attacks.
    cite: PHB, pg. 192
    text: |
      Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
  - title: Dodge
    short: Increase defenses.
    cite: PHB, pg. 192
    text: |
      Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.

      You lose this benefit if you are _incapacitated_ or if your speed drops to 0.
  - title: Escape
    short: Break a grapple.
    cite: PHB, pg. 195
    text: |
      To escape a grapple, you must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the grappler's Strength (Athletics) check.

      Escaping other conditions that restrain you (such as manacles) may require a Dexterity or Strength check, as specified by the condition.
  - title: Grapple
    short: Grab a target.
    cite: PHB, pg. 195
    text: |
      You can use the _Attack_ action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

      The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.

      Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).

      If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (its speed is set to 0).
  - title: Help
    short: Grant an ally advantage.
    cite: PHB, pg. 192
    text: |
      The target gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with.

      Alternatively, the target gains advantage on the next attack roll against against a creature within 5 feet of you.

      The advantage lasts until the start of your next turn.
  - title: Hide
    short: Keep out of sight.
    cite: PHB, pg. 192
    text: |
      **You can't hide from a creature that can see you.** You must have total cover, be in a heavily obscured area, be invisible, or otherwise block the enemy's vision.

      If you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position.

      **When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check and note the result.** Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the **Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.**

      **A creature notices you even if it isn't searching unless your Stealth check is higher than its Passive Perception.**

      Out of combat, you may also use a Dexterity (Stealth) check for acts like concealing yourself from enemies, slinking past guards, slipping away without being noticed, or sneaking up on someone without being seen or heard.
  - title: Improvise
    short: Any action not on this list.
    cite: PHB, pg. 193
    text: |
      When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.
  - title: Overrun
    short: Move through an enemy's space.
    cite: Improvised.
    text: |
      Athletics vs. Athletics to move through an opponent’s space. Advantage if larger than target, disadvantage if smaller.
  - title: Ready
    short: Choose a trigger and an action.
    cite: PHB, pg. 193
    text: |
      First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction.

      Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it.

      When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.

      When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration.
  - title: Search
    short: Look for something.
    cite: PHB, pg. 193
    text: |
      Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.
  - title: Shove
    short: Knock over or move target.
    cite: PHB, pg. 195
    text: |
      Using the _Attack_ action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

      The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.

      You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).

      If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.
  - title: Stabilize
    short: Prevent a creature's death.
    cite: PHB, pg. 197
    text: |
      Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check with DC 10.

      On a success, the creature is stable and no longer needs to make death saving throws.

      A stable creature regains 1 hit point after <Dice>1d4</Dice> hours.
  - title: Use Class Feature
    short: Some features use actions.
    cite: See class page for more information.
  - title: Use Object
    short: Interact, use special abilities.
    cite: PHB, pg. 193
    text: |
      You can interact with one object for free during your turn (such as drawing a weapon or opening a door). If you want to interact with a second object, use this action.

      When an object requires your action for its use, you also take this action.
  - title: Use Shield
    short: Equip or unequip a shield.
    cite: PHB, pgs. 144-146
    text: |
      A shield always takes an action to equip or unequip.

      Armor takes several minutes to equip or unequip.
