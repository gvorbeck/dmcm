    If a spell must be maintained with concentration, its description specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors can break your concentration:

    * You cast another spell that requires concentration.
    * You take damage. Succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw to maintain your contration, with a DC equal to 10 or half the damage you take, whichever is higher.
    * You're incapacitated or killed.
    * You're overwhelmed by an encounter by an enormous distraction, such as a wave crashing into you. Succeed on a DC 10 Constitution Saving Throw to maintain your concentration.
