  - title: Half-Cover
    short: If an obstacle blocks at least half of target's body.

      The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

      A target with half cover has a **+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws**.

      If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies.
  - title: Three-Quarters Cover
    short: If about three-quarters of target is covered by an obstacle.
    cite: PHB, pg. 196
    text: |
      The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

      A target with three-quarters cover has a **+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws**.

      If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies.
  - title: Full Cover
    short: If target is completely concealed by an obstacle.
    cite: PHB, pg. 196
    text: |
      A target with total cover **canâ€™t be targeted directly** by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect.

      If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies.
