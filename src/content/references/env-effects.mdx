      Creates a **lightly obscured** area.

      An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness.

      The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

    short: A heavily obscured area.

      Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.
