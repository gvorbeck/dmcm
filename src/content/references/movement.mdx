  - title: Climb
    short: "Cost: 10ft per 5ft"
    cite: PHB, pg. 182
    text: |
      May involve a Strength (Athletics) check if the climb is difficult.
  - title: Crawl
    short: "Cost: 10ft per 5ft"
    cite: PHB, pg. 182
  - title: Difficult Terrain
    short: "Cost modifier: +5ft per 5ft"
    cite: PHB, pg. 182
  - title: Drop Prone
    short: "Cost: 0ft"
    cite: PHB, pgs. 190-191,292
    text: |
      You can drop prone without using any of your speed

      To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation

      Dropping prone adds the _Prone_ condition (melee attacks against you have advantage, ranged attacks against you have disadvantage, your own attacks have disadvantage)
  - title: Flight
    short: "Cost: 5ft per 5ft of flight speed"
    cite: PHB, pg. 191
    text: |
      If a PC is able to fly, it moves like ground movement per its flight speed.

      If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise prevented from moving, it falls and takes 1d10 damage for every 10 feet it plummets. The ability to hover or magical means of flight negate this.
  - title: Grapple Move
    short: "Modifier: speed halved"
    cite: PHB, pg. 195
    text: |
      If you move while grappling another creature, your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

      See the attack action for how to grapple a creature.
  - title: High Jump
    short: "Cost: 5ft per 5ft"
    cite: PHB, pg. 182
    text: |
      You leap into the air a number of feet equal to **3 + your Strength modifier** if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.

      When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance.

      You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump.

      In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.
  - title: Improvise
    short: Any stunt not on this list
    text: |
      When you describe a kind of movement not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether it is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.
  - title: Long Jump
    short: "Cost: 5ft per 5ft"
    cite: PHB, pg. 182
    text: |
      You cover a number of feet up to your **Strength score** if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump.

      When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance

      May involve a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance). You hit the obstacle on a failed check.

      May involve a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet in difficult terrain. You land prone on a failed check.
  - title: Mounted Combat
    short: "Moving on a mount"
    cite: PHB, pg. 198
    text: |
      A willing creature that is one size larger than you and physically capable of carrying you can serve as a mount. You can mount or dismount a creature within 5 feet of you once during your move, though this costs half your movement speed.

      If an effect moves your mount against its will or you are knocked prone while you are mounted, make a DC 10 Dexterity save or be thrown off. You have advantage on this check if using a saddle. If your mount is knocked prone, you may take a reaction to land on your feet; otherwise, you fall prone within 5 feet of your mount.

      A mount that is not acting independently moves as you direct it, and may take the Dash, Disengage, and Dodge actions. A controlled mount can act on the turn you mount it. If the mount provokes an opportunity attack while youâ€™re on it, the attacker can choose to either target you or the mount.
  - title: Move
    short: "Cost: 5ft per 5ft"
    cite: PHB, pg. 190
    text: |
      If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed.

      You can move through a nonhostile creature's space.

      You can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you.

      Another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

      Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.
  - title: Stand Up
    short: "Cost: half movement speed"
    cite: PHB, pg. 190-191
    text: |
      You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.
  - title: Swim
    short: "Cost: 10ft per 5ft"
    cite: PHB, pg. 182
    text: |
      May involve a Strength (Athletics) check if the swim is difficult.
  - title: Underwater Combat
    short: "Swimming speed"
    cite: PHB, pg. 198
    text: |
      Creatures that do not have a swim speed have disadvantage on melee attacks not made with a dagger, shortsword, spear, or trident. Ranged weapons cannot hit beyond their normal range, and have disadvantage unless they are crossbows, nets, or javelin-type throwing weapons.

      Creatures immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.
