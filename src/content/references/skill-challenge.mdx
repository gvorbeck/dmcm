    1. Players roll initiative.
    2. On their turn, a player looks at the list of skills on their character sheet and picks one to use in a way that drives the plot forward. (eg; "I use Acrobatics and leap from the table to try tackling the creature")
    3. That player then rolls a d20 and adds the relevant skill modifier to the result.
    4. If that succeeds the DC check, it counts as a success. Players must achieve five successes before they get three failures.
    5. The next player does the same but cannot use a previously selected skill (Acrobatics would no longer be an available option for anyone chasing in the above example.)
