  - title: Dying
    cite: PHB, pg. 197
    text: |
      _If you are reduced to 0 hit points by damage that fails to kill you_, you fall unconscious and are dying.

      Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, **you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum**.

      _If you receive any healing_ you immediately regain consciousness again and no longer dying.

      When dying, at the start of each of your turns you make a death saving throw. Roll a d20 and do not add any modifiers.

      A 10 or higher is a success, 9 or lower is a failure.

      On your third success, you become stable.

      On your third failure, you die.

      Rolling a 1 counts as two failures.

      Rolling a 20 immediately causes you to regain 1 hit point.

      You can also be stabilized by an ally taking the Stabilize action and succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

      Once stable, you regain 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.
