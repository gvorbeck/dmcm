  - title: Blindsight
    short: Perceive your surroundings without relying on sight, within a certain radius.

      Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.
  - title: Darkvision
    short: A creature with Darkvision can see better in the dark or low light conditions, within a certain radius.
    cite: PHB, pgs. 183-184
    text: |
      Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can **see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light**, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned.

      However, the creature canâ€™t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

      Many creatures in the worlds of D&D, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision.
  - title: Truesight
    short: A creature with truesight can see everything in its true form, independent of the environment.
    cite: PHB, pg. 184
    text: |
      A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.

      Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.
